# A*-Algo-Visualizer
Visualizing the A* Algorithm to find the shortest distance between two points given.

A* Algorithm:
A* Search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals.

Informally speaking, A* Search algorithms, unlike other traversal techniques, it has “brains”. What it means is that it is really a smart algorithm which separates it from the other conventional algorithms. This fact is cleared in detail in below sections. 
And it is also worth mentioning that many games and web-based maps use this algorithm to find the shortest path very efficiently (approximation). 

### We can set up the start and end point and press Space to find the shortest path.

#### We can also add barriers.
